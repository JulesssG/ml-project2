Seismological stations around the world record 3 components particle motion  -  usually at 100Hz sampling rate.

An earthquake (EQ) radiates elastic waves in the earth that are picked on these seismometers. "P" / compressional waves arrive first, "S" / shear second. Surface waves (Rayleigh/ love) are also recorded. 

Typically, arrival of EQ waves will be picked at several stations  -  and then inversion of the travel time is performed to locate the EQ and estimate its magnitude. Picking the wave arrival at one station is thus routine  -  this is performed automatically by a number of algorithm (from simple thresholding, to more complex STA/SLA algorithms ) . Usually, after seismologist do QC and sometimes/always re-pick some arrivals "manually" (when more in the noise).
Can ML help?  i.e. harvest more EQ (of smaller size , buried in noise )

Note that EQ of multiple sizes occur  -  and obeys the Gutemberg-Richter law ,i.e. relation between Magnitude of an EQ and Occurrence.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) 


MicroEQ also occurs in the lab  -  same physics / different frequencies  -    we are in the process of finalizing our acquisition system for such passive recording.  -> we do not have a catalog yet -> hence we suggest to focus on seismological records following the approach developed in Perol et al.
